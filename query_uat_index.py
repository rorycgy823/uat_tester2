Query UAT Index with GraphRAG
=============================

This script demonstrates how to load a pre-built GraphRAG index
and use it to answer queries, which is the core of the UAT generation.

This script will:
1. Load the GraphRAG index from the local directory.
2. Take a user query as input.
3. Use the GraphRAG query engine to process the query.
4. Return the structured results, which can then be formatted into a UAT document.

This logic will later be integrated into the `app_chat.py` Flask application.
